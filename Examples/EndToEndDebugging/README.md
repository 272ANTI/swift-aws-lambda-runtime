# End-To-End Debugging

This sample project demonstrates how to write a simple Lambda function in Swift,
and how to use local debugging techniques that emulate how the Lambda function
would be invoked by the AWS Lambda Runtime engine.

The sample also includes a simple iOS application that calls the Lambda function
through the emulator, providing an end-to-end debugging experience.
